### Prompt

It's game day for SmackDown star Roman Reigns. His manager sent a crucial message about today's match, but to keep it secure, it's encoded in gibberish. Can you decrypt it and help him become champion again? The manager also hinted that the key to decrypting the message is hidden in Roman's name.
